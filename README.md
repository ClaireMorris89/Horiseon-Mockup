# Horiseon-Mockup

## Description 

Horiseon's webpage needed improvements in accessibility, as well as updating html and css coding.

By increasing accessibility, the webpage will be able to reach more users and more effectively communicate to all audiences. 

By improving the existing code, I was able to create html and css files that are easier for any developer to read and follow.

Completing this project helped me learn how to write concise and efficient code, and create a webpage with full accessibility.
